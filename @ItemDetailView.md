# ItemDetailView Migration

## Overview
The ItemDetailView has been refactored to follow a more concise naming convention and improve its architecture. The view displays detailed information about items (books, movies, etc.) with support for caching, background refresh, and error handling.

## Component Renaming
- `ItemDetailView` → `ItemView`
- `ItemDetailViewModel` → `ItemViewModel`
- `ItemDetailHeader` → `ItemHeader`
- `ItemDetailActions` → `ItemActions`
- `ItemDetailContent` → `ItemContent`

## Key Components

### ItemView
- Main container view that coordinates the display of item details
- Manages state through `ItemViewModel`
- Handles navigation and routing
- Supports pull-to-refresh and error handling

### ItemViewModel
- Manages item data loading and caching
- Handles error states and loading states
- Provides computed properties for UI display
- Integrates with `CacheService` for data persistence

### ItemHeader
- Displays item cover image using Kingfisher
- Shows title, rating, and metadata
- Responsive layout with proper spacing
- Handles image loading states

### ItemActions
- Primary action for adding items to shelf
- Share functionality with proper URL handling
- External resource links menu
- Integration with `AppAccountsManager`

## Implementation Details

### Data Flow
1. Initial load from cache (if available)
2. Background refresh from network
3. Cache update on successful network load
4. Error handling with user-friendly messages

### Caching Strategy
- Items are cached using `CacheService`
- Cache is updated on successful network requests
- Stale cache data is shown during refresh

### Error Handling
- Network errors are displayed in alerts
- Loading states are clearly indicated
- Fallback UI for missing data

## Known Issues
- [ ] Date formatting needs standardization
- [ ] Navigation state persistence
- [ ] Deep linking support
