# Shelf Feature Implementation

## Overview
Shelf display functionality moved from ProfileView to dedicated LibraryView tab for better organization and user experience.

## API Endpoints
- GET `/api/me/shelf/{type}`
  - Types: wishlist, progress, complete, dropped
  - Optional query params: category, page
  - Returns: PagedMarkSchema

## Models
1. ShelfType enum - Different shelf types (wishlist, progress, complete, dropped)
2. MarkSchema - Individual shelf item data
3. PagedMarkSchema - Paginated response structure
4. ItemSchema - Item details structure

## Implementation Plan
1. Create LibraryView and LibraryViewModel
2. Move shelf UI components from ProfileView
3. Enhance shelf display for dedicated tab view
4. Implement pagination and filtering

## Component Structure
- LibraryView/
  - LibraryView.swift (Main view)
  - LibraryViewModel.swift (Business logic)
  - Components/
    - ShelfItemView.swift (Item card)
    - ShelfFilterView.swift (Type/category filters)

## Features
- Shelf type switching (Want to Read, Reading, Completed, Dropped)
- Category filtering (All, Book, Movie, TV, Game)
- Infinite scrolling pagination
- Pull-to-refresh
- Loading states and error handling

## Changes
1. Initial Implementation:
   - Added ShelfService.swift for API communication
   - Created shelf models
   - Implemented shelf UI in ProfileView

2. Migration to Library Tab:
   - Created dedicated LibraryView
   - Moved shelf functionality from ProfileView
   - Enhanced UI for full-screen display
   - Improved navigation and filtering
   - Updated ContentView to include Library tab
   - Restored ProfileView to its original state

## Design Rationale
- Dedicated tab provides better visibility for collection management
- Separates profile information from content management
- More space for enhanced shelf features
- Clearer navigation structure

## Migration Process
1. Created new LibraryView and components
2. Moved shelf functionality from ProfileView
3. Updated tab bar in ContentView
4. Removed shelf-related code from ProfileView
5. Organized components into proper directory structure

## Future Improvements
- Add sorting options
- Implement search within library
- Add batch actions for multiple items
- Enhance item details view
- Add statistics and reading progress
