# ProfileView Design Document

## Overview
ProfileView displays user profile information and provides logout functionality.

## Architecture

### View Hierarchy
```
ProfileView
├── ProfileHeaderView
│   └── AvatarPlaceholderView
├── AccountInformationSection
└── LogoutSection
```

### Core Components
1. **ProfileViewModel**
   - Manages user data and state
   - Handles caching logic
   - Processes network requests
   - Supports both User and MastodonAccount types
   - Implements task-based async loading

2. **ProfileHeaderView**
   - Displays user avatar and basic information
   - Handles loading states
   - Supports animated transitions

3. **AvatarPlaceholderView**
   - Reusable avatar placeholder component
   - Supports loading and error states

## Dependency Injection
- Uses @EnvironmentObject to inject AppAccountsManager
- ViewModel receives dependencies via task
- Avoids temporary instance creation

## Caching Strategy
- Uses CacheService for user data caching
- Supports force refresh
- Auto-cleans on instance switch
- Implements proper error handling for cache misses
